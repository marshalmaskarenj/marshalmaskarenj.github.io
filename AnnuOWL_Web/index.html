				<h1>AnnuOWL | Annual evaluation of Occupant Wellbeing through Lighting</h1>
				<p>This is the documentation of AnnuOWL: an opensource workflow in Rhino Grasshopper developed for performing Radiance-based annual lighting simulations on horizontal and vertical planes, and evaluating visual and non-image-forming effects of light on occupant comfort and wellbeing, along with energy performance via metrics for light sufficiency. AnnuOWL can support early stage interventions in lighting and facade design.<br>
				<br>This tool requires minimal inputs from the user when evaluating the following metrics on an annual basis: <b>Lighting Sufficiency</b> (using editable recommendations of EN17037 for spatial daylight autonomy), <b>Non visual/circadian potential</b> (using annual hourly evaluation of Circadian Stimulus, a metric proposed by Lighting Research Centre), and <b>Protection from Discomfort Glare</b>, (using editable recommendations of EN17037 for glare protection using DGP as a metric). These metrics are displayed in an intuitive visualisation proposed as OVNI diagrams, and can help in design intervention through visualising metrics of occupant [Visual] comfort, [Circadian] health and energy use for lighting.<br>

					<h3 class="feature-title">The workflow of AnnuOWL</h3>
					<img src="images/Banner.gif" class="img-fluid">
					<p class="rounded-pp">As input, AnnuOWL needs building geometry, weather data <i>(as *.epw file)</i>, and pre-calculated annual spectral data as <i>(*.aowl file)</i>. <br>
					Parameters such as <i>occupancy schedule, table height, head height, grid distribution,</i> and <i>thresholds for metrics to be evaluated</i> are pre-populated with standard defaults, but are editable to match user needs. With these inputs, AnnuOWL can evaluate:<br>
					->  <i>Grid-based CBDMs (DA, cDA, UDI) and Average illuminance through occupied hours.</i><br>
					->  <i>Occupant-centered DA performance (High/Med/Min/NC) at table height using (editable) EN17037 target thresholds.</i><br>
					->  <i>Occupant-centered Circadian potential as non-visual performance (High/Med/Min/NC) at eye-height in four orientations.</i><br>
					->  <i>Occupant-centered Protection from discomfort glare (High/Med/Min/NC) at eye-height via (editable) EN17037 thresholds.</i><br>
					->  <i>Annual grid-based Spatial Daylight Autonomy compliance throughout floor area (High, Minimum, Medium).</i><br></p>

					<h3 class="feature-title">The OVNI diagrams</h3>
					<img src="images/animation-AnnuOWL1.gif" class="img-fluid">
					<p class="rounded-pp">The OVNI diagram is an infographic placed at every occupant's position, which describes the occupant-centered annual performance of the design towards energy use, comfort, and circadian health. <br> Each OVNI includes a hemisphere, surrounded by three rings. Each ring is sub-divided into four segments, facing N,E,S,W orientations.<br>-> The hemisphere represents <b>sufficient illuminance at table height</b>, and uses radiance grid-based evaluation for occupied hours.<br>Sub-divisions on the rings represent vertical viewing positions for four principal orientations, evaluated at the occupant eye-height.<br>-> The inner ring represents <b>Circadian potential & Non-visual performance</b>, as proxy for occupant health & well-being.<br>-> The middle ring represents <b>protection from discomfort glare</b> for each orientation, and describes occupant comfort.<br>-> The outer ring represents view quality. This is yet to be incorporated, and will describe occupant satisfaction.</p>

					<h3 class="feature-title">Grid: Climate-based Daylight Metrics</h3>
					<img src="images/AnnuOWL_GridSplash.gif" class="img-fluid">
					<p class="rounded-pp2">Using slider input, users can visualise Daylight Autonomy (DA), continuous Daylight Autonomy (cDA), useful daylight illuminance (UDI) or average illuminance through occupied hours, on a horizontal grid. With pre-populated standard default values, users can edit thresholds for CBDMs <i>(DA, UDI_lower, UDI_upper)</i>, occupancy hours <i>(start of business, close of business, days per week, weekend offset)</i>, and grid definition <i>(x-spacing, y-spacing, height above floor)</i> to match specific demands.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
					<h3 class="feature-title">OVNI | Hemisphere: Daylight Provision</h3>
					<img src="images/AnnuOWL_OVNI1Splash.gif" class="img-fluid">
					<p class="rounded-pp2">Daylight autonomy through occupied hours, in 4 bins of <i>High, Medium, Minimum and Non-compliant</i> is evaluated on <i>(editable)</i> table height. OVNI displays compliance for each location <i>(High/Medium/Minimum, Non-Compliant)</i> across minimum <i>(editable)</i> occupied hours. Defaults are EN17037 target thresholds: 750, 500 and 300 for High, Medium and Minimum, but users can edit these thresholds when evaluating for other standards, or to match future updates in the standard.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
					<h3 class="feature-title">OVNI | Inner ring: Non-visual/Circadian Potential</h3>
					<img src="images/AnnuOWL_OVNI2Splash.gif" class="img-fluid">
					<p class="rounded-pp2">Circadian Stimulus is evaluated separately for 4 orientations for each occupant position at <i>(editable)</i> eye-height, <b>via Truong's approximation</b>, using vertical illuminance and pre-calculated hourly CIE tristimulus z value (<i>from *.aowl file</i>). The CS sufficiency during morning hours for every <i>(editable)</i> occupied day is binned into High/Med/Min/Non-Compliant based on <i>(editable)</i> thresholds, and the OVNI ring segments visualise compliance for each view-point across minimum <i>(editable)</i> occupied days.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
					<h3 class="feature-title">OVNI | Second ring: Protection from Discomfort Glare</h3>
					<img src="images/AnnuOWL_OVNI3Splash.gif" class="img-fluid">
					<p class="rounded-pp2">Hourly DGP is also evaluated separately for 4 orientations for each occupant position at <i>(editable)</i> eye-height, <b>via simplified DGP approach</b>, using hourly vertical illuminance. Protection from glare across <i>(editable)</i> occupied annual hours is binned into High/Med/Min/Non-Compliant based on <i>(editable)</i> EN17037 thresholds: 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, >0.45 for High/Med/Min/Non-Compliant. The OVNI ring segments visualise compliance for each view-point across minimum <i>(editable)</i> occupied hours. </p>

				<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
					<h3 class="feature-title">Annual Heatmap: CS and DGP</h3>
					<img src="images/AnnuOWL_OVNI_Heatmap.gif" class="img-fluid">
					<p class="rounded-pp2">Annual heatmaps of CS and DGP can support time-specific investigations. This can help in designing facades that minimise discomfort glare at specific times, or schedule complementary circadian lighting in supplementing non-visual needs. To perform such in-depth analyses at occupant level, users can indicate occupant position-of-interest <i>(using slider input)</i>, and AnnuOWL will generate annual hourly heatmaps (365 x 24) for CS and DGP, across four orientations for the selected position.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
					<h3 class="feature-title">Legend: SDA Compliance</h3>
					<img src="images/AnnuOWL_SDASplash.gif" class="img-fluid">
					<p class="rounded-pp2">This singular grid-based compliance metric across the entire facility can be used to report the lighting performance towards sufficiency and daylight autonomy. Although with pre-populated standard defaults, occupants can modify grid definitions, occupancy hours, thresholds for Min/Med/High and definition of minimum occupied annual hours, in generating this metric. Similar metrics can also be designed for CS and DGP as 'percentage of occupants'.</p>
